I'm a physicist and software engineer. On GitHub you'll find me contributing to open source projects like [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) and [Pangeo](https://github.com/pangeo-data).

I currently work as a Research Software Engineer and Oceanographer at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, part of Columbia University.

Previously I completed a PhD in computational plasma physics for nuclear fusion, where I first got interested in the challenges of processing large amounts of scientific data.

I'm looking for my next opportunity! If you know of something you think might interest me, please email me at thomas dot nicholas at columbia dot edu.
