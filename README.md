### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a physicist turned scientific software engineer. I contribute to open source projects like [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) (as a core developer) and various other projects within the [Pangeo](https://github.com/pangeo-data) sphere.

I currently work at [Earthmover](https://earthmover.io/), a Public Benefit Corporation building "GitHub for data" on top of the open source Pangeo stack.

Previously I worked at [[C]Worthy](https://cworthy.org/), a non-profit [focused research organisation](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00018-5) building tools to verify that ocean-based carbon dioxide removal approaches would be effective and safe.

Before that I worked as a Research Software Engineer and Oceanographer at Columbia University. I worked with Ryan Abernathey as part of the [Climate Data Science Lab](https://ocean-transport.github.io/cds_lab.html), and as part of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.

Before that I completed a PhD in computational plasma physics for nuclear fusion, where I first got interested in the challenges of processing and sharing large amounts of scientific data.

Some projects I'm particularly proud of / excited about and my role in them:
- Xarray (core maintainer)
- Xarray-DataTree (original author, now folded into xarray upstream)
- VirtualiZarr (original author and lead developer)
- Cubed (cheerleader and author of the Cubed-Xarray integration)
- FROST (originator)

I'm interested in climate change as a physical problem and as a societal challenge, and in accelerating scientists' everyday work through better software tools.
