I'm a physicist and software engineer. On GitHub you'll find me contributing to open source projects like [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) and [Pangeo](https://github.com/pangeo-data).

I currently work as a Research Software Engineer and Oceanographer at Columbia University. I work with Ryan Abernathey as part of the [Climate Data Science Lab](https://ocean-transport.github.io/cds_lab.html), and as part of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.

Previously I completed a PhD in computational plasma physics for nuclear fusion, where I first got interested in the challenges of processing large amounts of scientific data.

I'm interested in climate change as a physical problem and as a societal challenge, and in accelerating scientists' everyday work through better software tools.
